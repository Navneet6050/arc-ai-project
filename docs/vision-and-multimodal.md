# ARC-AI Vision and Multimodal

This document covers ARC-AI's live vision pipeline, multimodal routing behavior, and provider-safe multimodal runtime constraints.

## GPT-4o Live Vision

ARC-AI extends static image understanding to realtime camera-assisted interaction.

### Pipeline

1. Frontend activates webcam stream.
2. On voice command, current frame is captured as base64 JPEG.
3. Frame is sent with command payload over `ai:stt:final`.
4. Backend routes vision context into the multimodal generation pipeline.
5. Vision analysis is synthesized into streaming response output.

### Feature Highlights

- realtime webcam-assisted command understanding
- frame capture synchronized to user utterance
- low-friction multimodal command flow
- seamless integration with existing streaming UX

## Pixtral Vision Routing

ARC-AI routes visual context to Pixtral within the provider-agnostic runtime.

### Behavior

- image payload enters runtime as attachment context
- multimodal-capable provider selection is enforced
- unsupported providers are excluded from invalid fallback paths
- attachment handling remains deterministic under fallback pressure

---

## Multimodal Runtime Safety

Production runtime protections prevent silent multimodal failure modes.

### Safety Guarantees

- invalid multimodal provider fallback is blocked
- silent attachment loss is prevented
- capability-aware routing is enforced before execution
- graceful failure is returned when no compatible provider exists

---

## Streaming Compatibility

Vision workflows preserve ARC-AI's realtime behavior.

### Preserved Contracts

- token streaming remains provider-independent
- interruption cleanup remains safe
- stream finalization remains guaranteed
- voice + multimodal orchestration remains compatible

---

## Related Runtime Update

The multimodal safety model was strengthened during provider-orchestrated runtime refactors.
